📌 Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset (Titanic dataset from Kaggle). The main goal is to understand the structure of the dataset, handle missing or inconsistent values, and explore relationships between different variables to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

🔍 Key Objectives

Load and inspect the dataset to understand its features and data types

Handle missing values, duplicate records, and incorrect data entries

Perform feature transformation and preprocessing for better analysis

Conduct exploratory data analysis using statistical summaries and visualizations

Study relationships between variables such as age, gender, class, and survival rate

Identify important patterns and trends that influence outcomes

📊 Tools and Techniques Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Statistical analysis for feature understanding

🚀 Outcome

The analysis provides insights into key factors affecting passenger survival and demonstrates how data cleaning and EDA help in preparing datasets for machine learning and predictive modeling tasks.
